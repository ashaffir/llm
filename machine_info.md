## CPU

Intel i7-14700, 20 cores / 28 threads

Max clock: 5.4 GHz

Modern instruction sets: AVX2, AVX-VNNI, FMA, AES, VAES, etc. (useful for ML inference, but no AVX-512)

Single NUMA node → no cross-socket latency

## Memory

64 GB RAM (≈56 GB available free at the moment)

8 GB swap (unused)

## Storage

3.6 TB NVMe SSD, mounted via LVM → very fast sequential and random I/O


## OS & Kernel

Ubuntu 24.04 with Linux 6.8 kernel → up-to-date features and optimizations
